Bugs/things that could be improved:
- current version assumes image dimension is ALWAYS 512(H)x1024(W)
- make exe
- make 3D plot also with phase dependent option

Documentation:
- open terminal in the folder where "source_GUI.py" is and type ">> python source_GUI.py" to launch the application
- "Load Image data" is the only button available. Gives a Error message when a non 'tif' file is selected
- IMPORTANT: you should have a midline in every contraction phase where you labeled tethers, AND you should have 1 and only 1 AVCanal!
