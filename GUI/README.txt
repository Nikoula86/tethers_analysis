USEFUL NOTES FOR TETHERS GUI

Bugs/things that could be improved:
- NOTE: current version assumes image is .tif file and output has to be pickle file
- make exe
- implement click delay (0.5 sec?) to prevent double overlapping points
- solve error message when closing dimensiondefiner window with X
- use same color/marker for analysis scripts as for GUI

Documentation:
- open terminal in the folder where "source_GUI.py" is and type ">> python source_GUI.py" to launch the application
- "Load Image data" is the only button available. Gives a Error message when a non 'tif' file is selected
- IMPORTANT: you should have a midline in every contraction phase where you labeled tethers, AND you should have 1 and only 1 AVCanal!
